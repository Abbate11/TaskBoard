# TaskBoard

## Description

Constructed a task board for keeping track of projects and placing them in a "to-do", "in-progress", or "done" section. You can create a task from a form within the site modal, and this appends the task card to the page and makes it draggable/droppable.  This was all the functionality I had time for. In the future I would make some changes to the card coloring based on the due date, and limit the droppable areas to the sections exclusively. I learned a lot about the best ways to write reusable functions, how to impliment drag/drop, how to use various web APIs such as JQuery, JQuery UI, and Bootstrap.
